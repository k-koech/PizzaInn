## BDD 
    As a customer, I would like to;
    - Choose the size of pizza I want e.g Small, Medium, Large
    - Choose what kind of crust I would like the pizza to have e.g Crispy, Stuffed, Gluten-free
    - Choose the topping(s) I want on my pizza.
    - Place an order for my Pizza and see the total charge for it.
    - Have an option to order as many pizzas as I want.
    - Have an option to have the pizza delivered or not.  If delivered I want to be alerted how much the delivery charge will be.
    - If I want my pizza to be delivered, I want to be prompted to enter where the delivery should be made and an alert saying '' your order will be delivered to your location"
    - See a checkout button that when clicked shows the total amount charged for the orders.
